Buttons come in 2 different styles: Primary and secondary. 

Secondary styles are often used in combination with a primary style button. This allows you to “highlight” the most important (i.e. “primary”) 
action in a given set of choices. The most popular pairing would be a “Save” (Primary) and “Cancel” (Secondary) button next to each other, with “Save” 
being the action we want to highlight. More information can be found in the “button bar” section below. 
This page provides details about available button styles, layout variants and sizes.

This is the primary button size. Use other button sizes sparingly and only in dedicated areas.
Buttons mainly use a flexible width. However, they may also be set to a fixed with, e.g. in narrow modals/popups or when using vertical button bars. 
In this case the text (and optional icon) is centered.
Button bars are used when a user can choose between different actions to e.g. resolve a dialogue, and thus mainly found in modals. 

Button bars should provide the user with a maximum of 3 (horizontal) or 2 (vertical) available actions. Vertical button bars span over the entire 
width of the modal. If a primary action exists (e.g. “Save” VS “Cancel”, where save would be the primary option), it is highlighted by using the primary 
button style, whereas the other options use the secondary button style. Only one action can be defined as primary. 

All available button sizes can be used for a button bar, but within the same button bar, the button size must be consistent.
