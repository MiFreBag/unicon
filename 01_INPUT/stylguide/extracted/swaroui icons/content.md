## Page 1

In general, SWARCO applications use the Font Awesome (FA) library (https://fontawesome.com/) in the classic solid style. If a specific case cannot be 
covered with the icons provided by fontawesome, please reach out to the design team for a custom icon. 
Icons are used in two sizes:  
16x16 px (standard)
24x24 px (sidebar navigation)
32x32px (map)

To ensure a consistent iconography (and therefore user experience), always check if your usecase is already covered in the list below. 
Whenever new icons are introduced, they must be added to the list.  Please place the new icon into the center of a 16x16 px artboard (or 
24x24px/32x32 px, depending on the use case) and add the Main Component to corresponding section in the Component/Asset collection.
DO NOT design your own icons or use other resources without prior approval.

Interactive / functional icons have a tooltip on hover. The tooltip is a concise and consistent description of the respective functionality. 

The icon color changes according to the current state (see below).
Some usecases require icons to display additional information. This information can be roughly devided in two categories:

Notification
Index

Notifications include alerts or any sort of information a user needs to track and where knowing the number of items is important. 
Indices on the other hand inform users about the number of choices/selections they have made. An example would be a filtering icon where users 
can select multiple items, and the number of selected items is then shown as index.

To reflect their different nature of information, both the style and position of these “bubbles” vary.
AA contrast
for icons
corner-radius: 4px;
padding: 4px;
Note:

please visit the “Tooltips” page.
Note for designers:
Please use the Icons/Interactive_Icons component 
in your designs to ensure consistent sizes & colors.
