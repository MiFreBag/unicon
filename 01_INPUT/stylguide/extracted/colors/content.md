UI colors may change according to the selected color mode. For SWARCO ecosystem applications, two color modes are available:

Light (mandatory)
Dark (optional) 

Detail pages for specific components/design elements always include design examples for both modes.
The following palettes cover all necessary UI colors for both modes.
Functional colors NEVER change, but stay the same across all color modes (light/dark) - except for the loading state (see below). 
This way, we ensure that the type/severity of an alert/notification will be immediately understood by a user, no matter which mode is currently active. 

The “Main” color is the primary color that should be used for each state. Light and Dark versions of the state colors provide some extra flexibility if 
needed. They should be used very sparingly however, and only in cases where using the main color will not work (e.g. for hover states on the map).
To ensure that users immediately understand, whether an (un)expected behaviour is related 

to the application itself (e.g. error while saving) = Application state or 
a device in the field (e.g. a signal head is not working properly) = Device/Operational state

 a slightly different color scheme is used to aid visual distinction. 

Each have their respective, and exclusive use. 
Do not mix application and device state colors. 
Note:
This distinction applies not only to colors, but also 
the overall design of notifications/alerts. 

Please visit the “Notifications” page for more 
information. 
Note:
To find out which colors are used in a specific component/design element: 

Select the component via click and 
Inspect the properties panel on the right.
